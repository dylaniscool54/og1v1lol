	The only way to solve this currently: https://www.justbuild.xyz/mouse
3. Why my controller doesn't work?
	We currently don't support controllers
4. I am stuck at 'Connecting' or have other connection issues, what can I do?
	Please try to refresh the page in order to start the connection process again,
